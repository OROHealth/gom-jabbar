Hello candidate!



We are super excited that you have been selected and interested to take on our technical challenge!

## Principle
This is meant for you to demonstrate your talent.

You do ***NOT*** need to:

- *do them all*: unless you're really feeling it and have the time, ***one*** project is enough for us to have a very 
  interesting conversation about your approach and code 💡
- *finish the project completely*: it is for you to decide what is enough code, documentation, tests, configuration, ... 
  to demonstrate your talents!🏋🏻‍♀️
- *pick the exact stack we use*: if you can demonstrate you know Node, Rust or React/Svelte, that's good, but if you're 
  a king of Python and Haskell, and you can show us fantastic code with it, prioritize impressing us 💪
- *pick the one you think will please us*: this is meant to be fun, pick one of the project you think you can enjoy 
  doing,  we're not looking for anything else than passion and software talent ❤️



## Basic requirement

To facilitate ***our*** life 💁‍♂️while reviewing everybody's challenges, it would be immensily appreciated if you could:

- *ensure we can build it*: even if it's unfinished, we should always commit working code, shouldn't we? 
  So if your component is unfinished, it's fine, but let's make sure it displays logs/empty space but do not crash or 
  reboot our smart cat feeder (🐈😻). Also do not expect us to have the planet installed locally. Make sure to list 
  what's needed to be able to build your project. 
- *demonstrate your best work*: actions speak louder than words! 
  we're not exactly interested in what you '***would do***' in the best of world where unicorn are reviewing our code 
  and giving us super-testing powers, but really what you **<u>do</u>** day-to-day when we have a sneaky bug to crush 
  before Thursday's beer 🍻 and we're still in the middle of a pandemic. Tips: make sure your submission match your 
  usual standard... 😉
- *submit your result as a PR*: yup, in Github and ideally with nice wit-filled commit message. 
  Put your answer for a specific challenge inside it's own directory, avoid deleting the other challenge folders! Also, 
  we <u>will</u> reject it in the end...<u>Don't panic!</u> 
  It means we made a decision and we want to keep our repo clean for the next candidates. Your submission will always be
  in our heart, especially if it's good.
- *we are interested in how you got to your final solution*: we want to see how you split your work and how you chunk it 
  so that its easy to work, collaborate on and review, so please, do not squash your branch when you send the PR, we 
  want  to see it all, even if you’re not super proud of it! You can of course re-organise your commits after the fact 
  if you are into that sort of thing...
- *test your submission*: put yourself in our shoes. double-check.👓
  Git clone the repo under a different name locally, then make sure everything is squeaky when it's building. 
  Unfortunately, we will spend exactly 5 min trying to make it work if it doesn't. Make the best of those 5 min👸🏻 
- ***<u>have fun!</u>***
