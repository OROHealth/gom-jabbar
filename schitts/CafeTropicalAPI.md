# Schitt's Creek Cafe Tropical sale platform

## Created using a MERN stack,

the Api lets you store customers informationorders and the caf√©'s menu, and monitor employees "performance" (mostly Moira's, not sure why :)),

Considering the scope of his project I based the Api on RESTfull principles, although we can already see some performance issues. A full fledged one would probably benefit from using a query language like GraphQL.

### Installation

cd into the schitts directory then in the terminal enter \$yarn full-install. Concurrently will be installed, then this dependancy will install all the necessary dependancies for both the Server and the React app. (for your convenience!)

### Getting started

in a new terminal cd into the client directory and enter yarn start.
Repeat the samce action in the server directory.
