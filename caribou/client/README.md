# caribou-client
"Caribou vs Humans" app will help the planet stay clean from humans. Caribou will be able to track humans and measure their level of littering per location. They can also signal their presence. Once successfully registered and logged in, users will be able to chat and exchange secret information about how to kick humans off the planet.
The app will be using Google map API. It will help display the presence of humans in current or selected locations.
Itâ€™s user-friendly, and accessible to every caribou.
