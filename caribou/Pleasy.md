# Pleasing the caribou

Since the dawn of time, Caribou have been pretending to be stupid mammals but secretly observing the evolution of those 
trashy unruly specimen of biped unoptimality called humans. 

Recently though, the Committee to Avoid Humans At All Point (CAHAAP) has discovered that it was becoming very difficult 
to continue gather and exchange valuable intel using their encrypted antlers patterns.

To help them, we, the Assembly of Inter-Human-Caribou Harmony  (IHCH), have decided to provide them with the full 
service of a modern experience while using their CaribouPhones (an Android variant, obviously):

- an API that allows :
  - to signal the presence of a human in a specific location with trashing level and level of excitement 
  - to request if the presence of a human was signaled in a specific location
  - to signal a Caribou is ready to antler-exchange
  - is highly secured
- a Single Page Application that 
  - displays a map of the current vincinity and display the zone where human are currently actively trashing the world
  - signals when a human has quit the zone 
  - allows them to signal the presence of human and rate its trashing level
  - presents a live-chat to allow Antler-exchange using the highly secure Caribou algorithm: every vowel is replaced by 
    'muu' and every consonant is replaced by 'grm'
  - is secured to only allow signing up with addresses that are Cariboued (they contain 'carib' at the end of the 
    username, like bruno-carib@orohealth.me is my Caribou address, yes, I am a secret Caribou agent)



### Bonus/Optional

- Make sure that an individual human can't be tracked?
- Make sure that an individual Caribou can't be tracked? 
- Storing the chat conversation in a reversible encrypted format that only participant in the conversation can decrypt?
